Happy new year everyone! [As from our announcement on discourse end of last year,](https://discourse.ubuntu.com/t/ubucon-asia-2024-to-be-held-in-jaipur-india/41054) The 4th edition of UbuCon Asia will be held in Jaipur, India. There are some few updates and changes since then, So we would like to share with you!

## Dates moved in advance
Our orignal plan was to hold on October 4th to 6th. But as these dates are closer with Ubuntu Summit which usually happens on early November, We moved our event dates in advance so that people from Ubuntu community would be able to attend both event! **The new dates are August 31st to September 2nd.** You may now mark your calendar and save your dates!

## Venue
Event venue of this year will be [JECRC University in Jaipur, India.](https://maps.app.goo.gl/saSFBMYQY1QQzvTTA) Our local team folks are working hard to acquire the venue. We'll post updates once venue confirmed!

## Sponsorship
Working hard on it! Benefits would be similar, But pricing could be different a bit. We also plan to more diverse range of sponsorship levels. From this year, We plan to use 2 fiscal host to manage fundraising. A local fiscal sponsor that local team brought, And another one for manging funds at global level. If you're local sponsor, you will be invoiced by local fiscal sponsor. If not, you'll likely to be invoiced by our global fiscal sponsor.

## Joint event with GNOME.Asia
