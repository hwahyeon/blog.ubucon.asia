The 4th edition of UbuCon Asia is now looking for companies, organization or individuals who would like to sponsor us to make things happen! **UbuCon**s (or **Ubuntu Conference**s) are regional events driven by community and group of volunteers. The events bring together hundreds of Open Source enthusiasts, users, developers, and contributors to share their stories and experiences regarding not only Ubuntu but, free and open source technologies on servers, desktops, cloud, IoT and much more. 

Since 2021, UbuCon Asia has become a vibrant hub for local Ubuntu communities across Asia. Our journey started with a virtual event in 2021, followed by successful in-person gatherings in Seoul, South Korea (2022) and Surakarta, Indonesia (2023, jointly held with LibreOffice Conf Asia). This year, we're excited to be hosted at JECRC University, Jaipur, India!

Being a non-profit event, organized by volunteers without compensation or stable funds, we rely on sponsorships to host these events. Events like these allow community members to learn, share and grow together, meeting many of their peers in person, sometimes even for the first time. Your generous sponsorship will also enable you to engage with Ubuntu project and community and will who your commitment to the further development of free and open source software as well as growth of Ubuntu and FOSS community.
